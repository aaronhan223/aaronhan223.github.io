About Me
======
I am currently a PhD candidate at University of Texas at Austin, where I am associated with [IDEAL](https://www.ideal.ece.utexas.edu/index.html), [WNCG](https://www.wncg.org/) and [IFML](https://www.ifml.institute/). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Joydeep Ghosh](https://www.ideal.ece.utexas.edu/~ghosh/), and collaborate with [Prof. Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/) and [Prof. Qiang Liu](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lqiang/). I got my Bachelor's degree in electronics and eletrical engineering from [The University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) in 2017.

Research Interests
======
I am boardly interested in developing principles and practice of trustworthy machine learning. Specifically, I have been focused on the following research topics

 - **Uncertainty quantification**: to better capture the epistemic uncertainty in common predictive modeling and classification problems. 
 - **Robustness**: to strengthen the model's defense on adversarial attack, data poisoning and distribution drift, and construct certified robustness to provide safety guarantee via statistical modeling and optimization methods. 
 - **Interpretability**: to build human understandable explanations for model decisions, with particular focus on non i.i.d. data such as time series or sequential data.

Besides, I'm also interested in novel ML methods for transformative applications in healthcare. Here is my [research statement](http://academicpages.github.io/files/Research_Statement.pdf).
